        <h2 class="heading2">What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="txt">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool
          designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
          development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br /><br />
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="txt">Join</span> leverages the
          principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
          intuitive, visual interface. <br /><br />
          It is important to note that <span class="txt">Join</span> is designed
          as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
          usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we
          cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or
          other aspects of quality regarding <span class="txt">Join</span>.

        <h2 id="how-to-use" class="heading2">How to use it</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
          <span class="heading">Join</span>:

              <h3 class="heading1">Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p class="txtsub">
                When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a
                default board. This board represents your project and contains
                four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                "Done".
              </p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="heading1">Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p class="txtsub">
                In <span class="blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
                on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
                with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h3 class="heading1">Adding Cards</h3>
              <p class="txtsub">
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="heading1">Moving Cards</h3>
              <p class="txtsub">
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
                on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
                another.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="heading1">Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p class="txtsub">
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
                the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                action is irreversible.
