        <h2 class="heading2">
            Introduction and overview</h2>
        <p>
            We have written this data protection declaration (version 01.02.2024-112713231) in order to explain to you, in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller - and that of Processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) – process, will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.
            In short: We inform you comprehensively about the data we process about you.
            
            Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terms. This data protection declaration, however, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. To the extent that it promotes transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links to further information are provided and graphics are used. We thereby inform you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data as part of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you make as brief, unclear and legal-technical statements as possible, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or two pieces of information that you didn't know before.
            If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the legal notice, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the legal notice.
        </p><br>
        <h2 id="how-to-use" class="heading2">Scope of application</h2>
        <p><br>
            This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data that companies commissioned by us (contract processors) process. By personal data we mean information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this data protection declaration includes:

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading2">
                Legal basis</h2>
        <p>
            In the following data protection declaration we provide you with transparent information about the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.
            As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access to the EU -Law, read at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679.
            
            We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:
            
            Consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be saving the data you entered on a contact form.
            Contract (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): In order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
            Legal obligation (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.
            Legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.
            Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of public authority as well as the protection of vital interests generally do not apply to us. If such a legal basis is relevant, it will be shown in the appropriate place.
            
            In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:
            
            In Austria, this is the Federal Law on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act), or DSG for short.
            The Federal Data Protection Act, or BDSG for short, applies in Germany.
            If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.

            Storage period</h2>
            <p>
               
                Our general criterion is that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased, for example for accounting purposes.

                If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible and unless there is an obligation to store it.
                
                We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.

                Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
            <p>
               
                In accordance with Articles 13, 14 GDPR, we inform you of the following rights to which you are entitled so that data is processed fairly and transparently:

                According to Article 15 GDPR, you have a right to information as to whether we are processing your data. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information:
                for what purpose we carry out the processing;
                the categories, i.e. the types of data, that are processed;
                who receives this data and, if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;
                how long the data is stored;
                the existence of the right to rectification, deletion or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;
                that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);
                the origin of the data if we did not collect it from you;
                whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to create a personal profile for you.
            </p>
            <p id="text-bottom">According to Article 16 GDPR, you have a right to correction of data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.
                According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to deletion (“right to be forgotten”), which specifically means that you can request the deletion of your data.
                According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing, which means that we are only allowed to store the data but not use it any further.
                According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that upon request we will provide you with your data in a common format.
                According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right to object, which, once enforced, will result in a change to the processing.
                If the processing of your data is based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.
                If data is used to conduct direct advertising, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.
                If data is used to carry out profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We are then no longer allowed to use your data for profiling.
                According to Article 22 GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (e.g. profiling).
                According to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</p>
